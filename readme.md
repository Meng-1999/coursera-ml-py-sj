## About
If you've finished the amazing introductory Machine Learning on Coursera by Prof. Andrew Ng, you probably got familiar with Octave/Matlab programming. With this repo, you can re-implement them in Python, step-by-step, visually checking your work along the way, just as the course assignments.

## How to start
This repository is my implementation of the assignments. You can do your own by cloning this [repo](https://github.com/nsoojin/coursera-ml-py).
